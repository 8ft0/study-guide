### Man Page: BusyBox

**NAME**
```
busybox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux
```

**SYNOPSIS**
```
busybox [function [arguments]...]
```

**DESCRIPTION**
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave much like their GNU counterparts.

**COMMANDS**
BusyBox has multiple built-in commands. Below are a few examples:

- **ash**: A shell command interpreter.
- **cat**: Concatenate files and print on the standard output.
- **cp**: Copy files and directories.
- **grep**: Print lines matching a pattern.

**OPTIONS**
Each built-in command supports various options. For instance:

- **cp**:
  - `-a`: Archive mode, equivalent to -dpR.
  - `-f`: Force, overwrite existing files.

**EXAMPLES**
Run the BusyBox shell:
```sh
busybox ash
```

Copy a file using BusyBox:
```sh
busybox cp source_file target_file
```

Search for a pattern in a file using BusyBox:
```sh
busybox grep 'pattern' file
```

**SEE ALSO**
Refer to individual command help for detailed options using:
```sh
busybox command --help
```
