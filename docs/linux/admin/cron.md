### Cron Jobs and Scheduled Tasks Cheat Sheet

**Purpose**: To provide a quick reference for creating and managing scheduled tasks using cron on a Linux system.

---

#### Understanding Cron

- **Cron**: A time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. Users can schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals.
- **Crontab**: A file containing the schedule of cron entries. Each user has their own crontab file.

#### Cron Syntax

1. **Cron Job Format**:
   ```plaintext
   * * * * * command
   ```
    - **Field Breakdown**:
        - `* * * * *`: Minute (0-59), Hour (0-23), Day of Month (1-31), Month (1-12), Day of Week (0-7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
        - `command`: The command to be executed

2. **Examples**:
    - Run a script every day at 2:30 AM:
      ```sh
      30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh
      ```
    - Run a command every 15 minutes:
      ```sh
      */15 * * * * /path/to/command
      ```
    - Run a task every Monday at 5 PM:
      ```sh
      0 17 * * 1 /path/to/task
      ```

#### Managing Crontab

1. **Edit Crontab**:
    ```sh
    crontab -e
    ```
    - This opens the current user's crontab file in the default text editor.

2. **List Crontab Entries**:
    ```sh
    crontab -l
    ```
    - Displays the current user's crontab entries.

3. **Remove Crontab**:
    ```sh
    crontab -r
    ```
    - Removes the current user's crontab file.

4. **Edit Crontab for Another User** (requires sudo):
   ```sh
   sudo crontab -u <username> -e
   ```

#### Special Strings in Cron

  - **@reboot**: Run once, at startup.
    ```sh
    @reboot /path/to/script.sh
    ```
  - **@yearly**: Run once a year, equivalent to `0 0 1 1 *`.
    ```sh
    @yearly /path/to/script.sh
    ```
  - **@monthly**: Run once a month, equivalent to `0 0 1 * *`.
    ```sh
    @monthly /path/to/script.sh
    ```
  - **@weekly**: Run once a week, equivalent to `0 0 * * 0`.
    ```sh
    @weekly /path/to/script.sh
    ```
  - **@daily**: Run once a day, equivalent to `0 0 * * *`.
    ```sh
    @daily /path/to/script.sh
    ```
  - **@hourly**: Run once an hour, equivalent to `0 * * * *`.
    ```sh
    @hourly /path/to/script.sh
    ```

#### Redirecting Output

  - Redirect standard output and standard error to a file:
    ```sh
    * * * * * /path/to/command >> /path/to/logfile 2>&1
    ```

#### Environment Variables in Crontab

- **Setting Variables**: You can set environment variables in the crontab file.
  ```sh
  PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
  SHELL=/bin/bash
  ```
    - Example:
      ```sh
      PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
      SHELL=/bin/bash
      0 5 * * * /path/to/command
      ```

#### Anacron

- **Anacron**: Similar to cron but used for tasks that need to be run periodically with a guarantee that they will be executed, even if the system is down for some period.
- **Configuration Files**:
    - `/etc/anacrontab`: Main configuration file for anacron.
    - **Example**:
      ```sh
      # /etc/anacrontab: configuration file for anacron

      # period   delay   job-identifier   command
      1         5       cron.daily       run-parts /etc/cron.daily
      7         10      cron.weekly      run-parts /etc/cron.weekly
      30        15      cron.monthly     run-parts /etc/cron.monthly
      ```

#### Common Commands and Tips

1. **Check Cron Logs**:
    - Syslog:
      ```sh
      sudo grep CRON /var/log/syslog
      ```
    - Journalctl (systemd-based systems):
      ```sh
      sudo journalctl -u cron
      ```

2. **Testing Cron Jobs**:

    - Ensure the script or command works by running it manually before scheduling.
    - Include `echo` statements or logging within the script to verify execution.

By using this cheat sheet, new starters can efficiently create, manage, and troubleshoot cron jobs, ensuring tasks are scheduled and executed as needed on a Linux system.
