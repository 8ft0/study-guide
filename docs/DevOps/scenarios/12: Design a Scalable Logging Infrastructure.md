# Scenario 12: Design a Scalable Logging Infrastructure

**Task:** Design a scalable logging infrastructure for a microservices architecture.

**Approach:**

1. **Log Aggregation:**
    - Use a centralized log aggregation system like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd + Elasticsearch.
    - Configure microservices to send logs to the log aggregation system using Fluentd or Logstash.
2. **Log Storage:**
    - Store logs in a scalable and highly available storage system like Elasticsearch or a cloud-based log storage service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs, Google Cloud Logging).
3. **Structured Logging:**
    - Implement structured logging in JSON format to make logs easily searchable and parsable.
    - Include relevant metadata (e.g., request IDs, user IDs, timestamps) in log entries.
4. **Log Processing:**
    - Use Logstash or Fluentd to process and enrich logs before storing them.
    - Implement filters and parsers to extract meaningful information from logs.
5. **Visualization:**
    - Set up Kibana or Grafana dashboards to visualize log data.
    - Create custom dashboards for different microservices and use cases.
6. **Alerting:**
    - Configure alerts based on log patterns and thresholds using tools like ElastAlert or Grafana Alerts.
    - Set up alerting channels (e.g., Slack, email, PagerDuty) for timely notifications.
7. **Retention and Archiving:**
    - Define log retention policies to manage storage costs and comply with regulatory requirements.
    - Archive older logs to cost-effective storage solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
