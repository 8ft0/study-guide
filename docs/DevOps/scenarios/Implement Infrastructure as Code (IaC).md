# Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Task:** Design an infrastructure as code setup to manage a multi-cloud environment.

**Approach:**

1. **Tool Selection:**
    - Use Terraform as the IaC tool for managing resources across AWS, GCP, and Azure.
2. **State Management:**
    - Use a centralized backend (e.g., AWS S3, Terraform Cloud) to store the Terraform state file securely.
    - Enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.
3. **Modular Design:**
    - Organize Terraform configurations into reusable modules (e.g., VPC, security groups, EC2 instances).
    - Use version control to manage module versions.
4. **Environment Separation:**
    - Separate configurations for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production) using workspaces or directories.
    - Implement environment-specific variables and secrets management.
5. **Provisioning:**
    - Write Terraform configurations to provision resources across AWS, GCP, and Azure.
    - Ensure configurations are idempotent and can handle incremental changes.
6. **CI/CD Integration:**
    - Integrate Terraform with CI/CD pipelines to automate infrastructure provisioning and updates.
    - Use tools like Atlantis for pull request-driven workflows.
7. **Compliance and Security:**
    - Implement security scanning tools like tfsec or Checkov to scan Terraform code for vulnerabilities.
    - Enforce policies using Sentinel or Open Policy Agent (OPA).
