# Scenario 6: Design a High Availability Architecture

**Task:** Design a high availability architecture for a database-backed web application.

**Approach:**

1. **Load Balancing:**
    - Use a load balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple application servers.
2. **Application Layer:**
    - Deploy multiple instances of the application across different availability zones.
    - Use auto-scaling groups to automatically adjust the number of instances based on traffic.
3. **Database Layer:**
    - Use a managed database service like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.
    - Enable multi-AZ deployment for the database to ensure high availability.
4. **Data Replication:**
    - Set up read replicas to distribute read traffic and ensure data redundancy.
    - Implement automated backups and snapshots for disaster recovery.
5. **Caching Layer:**
    - Implement a caching layer using Redis or Memcached to reduce database load and improve performance.
6. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
    - Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and CloudWatch.
    - Set up alerts for key metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, response time).
7. **Disaster Recovery:**
    - Plan for disaster recovery by setting up cross-region replication and backup.
    - Regularly test failover procedures to ensure readiness.
