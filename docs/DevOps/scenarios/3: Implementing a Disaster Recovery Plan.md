# Scenario 3: Implementing a Disaster Recovery Plan

**Task:** Design a disaster recovery plan for a web application hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**Approach:**

1. **Identify Critical Components:**
    - Web servers, database servers, and storage.
    - Determine RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
2. **Data Backup:**
    - Use GCP's Cloud Storage for backups.
    - Schedule regular snapshots of persistent disks.
    - Backup databases using Cloud SQL automated backups.
3. **Redundancy and Failover:**
    - Deploy applications across multiple regions.
    - Use Global Load Balancer to distribute traffic.
    - Set up instance groups with auto-scaling.
4. **Automated Recovery:**
    - Use GCP Deployment Manager or Terraform for infrastructure as code.
    - Automate recovery scripts to spin up resources in the backup region.
    - Implement database replication to a secondary region.
5. **Testing and Validation:**
    - Regularly test the disaster recovery plan.
    - Conduct failover drills to ensure processes work as expected.
    - Update the disaster recovery plan based on test outcomes.
6. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
    - Use Stackdriver for monitoring and logging.
    - Set up alerts for resource failures and performance issues.
