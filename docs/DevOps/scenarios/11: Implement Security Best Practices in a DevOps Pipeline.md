# Scenario 11: Implement Security Best Practices in a DevOps Pipeline

**Task:** Design a DevOps pipeline with integrated security best practices.

**Approach:**

1. **Source Code Management:**
    - Use a version control system like Git with branch protection rules.
    - Implement code reviews and approval processes before merging to the main branch.
2. **Static Analysis:**
    - Integrate static code analysis tools like SonarQube, ESLint, or pylint to scan for vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
    - Ensure these checks run automatically on every pull request.
3. **Dependency Scanning:**
    - Use dependency scanning tools like OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk, or WhiteSource to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    - Ensure these scans are part of the CI pipeline.
4. **Container Security:**
    - Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, or Aqua Security.
    - Use base images from trusted sources and keep them up to date.
5. **Secrets Management:**
    - Use secrets management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault to manage sensitive information securely.
    - Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files.
6. **Dynamic Analysis:**
    - Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) using tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
    - Run these tests in a staging environment before deploying to production.
7. **Continuous Monitoring:**
    - Set up continuous monitoring with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
    - Implement alerts for security incidents and anomalies.
