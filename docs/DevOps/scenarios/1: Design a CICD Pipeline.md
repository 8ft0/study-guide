# Scenario 1: Design a CI/CD Pipeline

**Task:** Design a CI/CD pipeline for deploying a microservices application to a Kubernetes cluster.

**Approach:**

1. **Source Code Management:**
    - Use Git for version control.
    - Each microservice has its own repository.
    - Use feature branching strategy.
2. **Build and Test:**
    - Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions to trigger builds on pull requests.
    - Containerize each microservice using Docker.
    - Run unit tests and integration tests during the build process.
    - Use tools like SonarQube for code quality checks.
3. **Continuous Integration:**
    - Merge changes to the main branch triggers a new build.
    - Use Docker to build and tag images.
    - Store Docker images in a registry like Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
4. **Continuous Deployment:**
    - Deploy to a staging environment first.
    - Use Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts for deployment.
    - Run end-to-end tests in the staging environment.
    - If tests pass, promote the build to the production environment.
5. **Monitoring and Feedback:**
    - Implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
    - Set up alerting for failed deployments or performance issues.
    - Use logging tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for troubleshooting.
