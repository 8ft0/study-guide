# Scenario 8: Design a Logging and Monitoring System

**Task:** Design a comprehensive logging and monitoring system for a distributed application.

**Approach:**

1. **Log Aggregation:**
    - Use a centralized log aggregation tool like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog.
    - Set up Fluentd or Logstash agents on application servers to forward logs to the central system.
2. **Structured Logging:**
    - Implement structured logging in applications to include context and metadata (e.g., request IDs, user IDs).
    - Use JSON format for logs to facilitate parsing and querying.
3. **Metrics Collection:**
    - Use Prometheus to collect and store metrics from application servers and infrastructure.
    - Define custom metrics for critical application and business processes.
4. **Visualization:**
    - Set up Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics and logs.
    - Create dashboards for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
5. **Alerting:**
    - Configure alerts based on key metrics and log patterns using Prometheus Alertmanager or Grafana Alerts.
    - Set up alert channels (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty) for timely notifications.
6. **Tracing:**
    - Implement distributed tracing using tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to trace requests across microservices.
    - Use tracing to identify performance bottlenecks and dependencies.
7. **Retention and Compliance:**
    - Define log retention policies based on business and compliance requirements.
    - Implement data retention and archiving strategies to manage storage costs.

These scenarios cover a wide range of challenges that you might face as a DevOps Manager. Be prepared to explain your solutions in detail, justify your choices, and discuss any potential trade-offs.
