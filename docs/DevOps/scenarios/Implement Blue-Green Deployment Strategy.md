# Implement Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

**Task:** Design a blue-green deployment strategy for a web application hosted on AWS.

**Approach:**

1. **Environment Setup:**
    - Create two identical environments (Blue and Green).
    
    - Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk or ECS for environment management.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins or AWS CodePipeline.
    - Ensure the pipeline builds, tests, and deploys to the Blue environment first.
3. **Traffic Management:**
    - Use AWS Route 53 for DNS routing.
    - Initially route all traffic to the Blue environment.
4. **Deployment Process:**
    - Deploy the new version of the application to the Green environment.
    - Perform thorough testing in the Green environment to ensure it’s functioning as expected.
5. **Switch Traffic:**
    - If tests pass, switch the traffic from Blue to Green using Route 53.
    - Monitor the Green environment for any issues.
6. **Rollback Strategy:**
    - Keep the Blue environment running until you’re confident the Green environment is stable.
    - In case of any issues, quickly switch back the traffic to the Blue environment.
7. **Automation and Monitoring:**
    - Automate the switching process using scripts or AWS Lambda functions.
    - Implement monitoring with CloudWatch and set up alerts for anomalies.
