# Implement a Zero-Downtime Deployment Strategy

**Task:** Design a zero-downtime deployment strategy for a web application hosted on a cloud platform.

**Approach:**

1. **Blue-Green Deployment:**
    - Create two identical environments (Blue and Green).
    - Use a load balancer to route traffic to the active environment (initially Blue).
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - Set up CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
    - Ensure the pipeline builds, tests, and deploys to the inactive environment (initially Green).
3. **Testing:**
    - Conduct thorough testing in the Green environment to ensure the new version is stable and functional.
    - Include automated tests and user acceptance testing (UAT).
4. **Traffic Switch:**
    - Once testing is successful, switch the traffic from Blue to Green using the load balancer.
    - Monitor the new environment closely for any issues.
5. **Rollback Strategy:**
    - Keep the previous environment (Blue) running until the new environment (Green) is stable.
    - In case of any issues, quickly switch back the traffic to the Blue environment.
6. **Automation and Monitoring:**
    - Automate the switching process using scripts or tools like AWS Lambda.
    - Implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana to ensure smooth transitions.
