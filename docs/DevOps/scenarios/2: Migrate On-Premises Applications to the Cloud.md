    - Transfer files to S3 using AWS Snowball or AWS Transfer Family.
4. **Application Deployment:**
    - Containerize applications using Docker if applicable.
    - Deploy applications to ECS/EKS or directly to EC2 instances.
    - Implement CI/CD pipelines using AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy.
5. **Testing and Validation:**
    - Conduct thorough testing in a staging environment.
    - Validate performance, security, and functionality.
6. **Monitoring and Optimization:**
    - Use CloudWatch for monitoring.
    - Implement cost management tools to optimize cloud spending.
