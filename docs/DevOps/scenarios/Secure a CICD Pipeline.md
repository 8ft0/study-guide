# Secure a CI/CD Pipeline

**Task:** Design a CI/CD pipeline with integrated security checks.

**Approach:**

1. **Source Code Management:**
    - Use Git for version control.
    - Implement branch protection rules.
2. **Security Scanning:**
    - Integrate SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools like SonarQube.
    - Use dependency scanning tools like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk.
3. **Build and Test:**
    - Use Jenkins or GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
    - Containerize applications using Docker.
    - Run unit tests, integration tests, and security tests.
4. **Container Security:**
    - Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair or Trivy.
    - Enforce the use of approved base images.
5. **Deployment Security:**
    - Use Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) to limit permissions.
    - Implement network policies to control traffic flow.
6. **Monitoring and Compliance:**
    - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
    - Implement logging and auditing using ELK stack.
    - Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).
