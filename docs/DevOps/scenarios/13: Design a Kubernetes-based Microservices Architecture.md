# Scenario 13: Design a Kubernetes-based Microservices Architecture

**Task:** Design a Kubernetes-based architecture for a microservices application.

**Approach:**

1. **Cluster Setup:**
    - Use a managed Kubernetes service like AWS EKS, Google GKE, or Azure AKS.
    - Set up a multi-node cluster with nodes spread across multiple availability zones for high availability.
2. **Namespace Management:**
    - Organize microservices into namespaces for better resource management and isolation.
    - Use separate namespaces for development, staging, and production environments.
3. **Service Discovery:**
    - Use Kubernetes Services and DNS for service discovery.
    - Implement Ingress controllers for external access to services.
4. **Configuration Management:**
    - Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing configuration data and sensitive information.
    - Use Helm charts or Kustomize for templating and managing Kubernetes manifests.
5. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
    - Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Argo CD for continuous deployment to Kubernetes.
6. **Scaling and Resilience:**
    - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) to scale microservices based on CPU or memory usage.
    - Use Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) and node affinity rules to ensure resilience.
7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
    - Use Fluentd or Fluent Bit to collect and forward logs to a centralized logging system.
8. **Security and Compliance:**
    - Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for fine-grained access control.
    - Use Network Policies to control communication between microservices.
    - Scan container images for vulnerabilities and enforce security best practices.
