## HackerRank Challenge: Count Palindromic Subsequences

### Problem Statement

Given a string \( S \), count the number of palindromic subsequences in \( S \). A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindromic subsequence reads the same backward as forward.

### Input Format

- A single string \( S \) containing only lowercase English letters. The length of \( S \) will not exceed 1000 characters.

### Output Format

- An integer representing the number of palindromic subsequences in the string.

### Constraints

- \( S \) will contain only lowercase English letters.

### Example

#### Input
```
abc
```

#### Output
```
3
```

### Explanation

In the input string "abc":
- The palindromic subsequences are "a", "b", and "c". Thus, the output is 3.

### Function Signature
```python
def count_palindromic_subsequences(S: str) -> int:
    # Your code here
```

### Sample Input 1
```
aaa
```

### Sample Output 1
```
6
```

### Sample Input 2
```
abcb
```

### Sample Output 2
```
6
```

## Solution

Here's a solution in Python for the "Count Palindromic Subsequences" problem:

```python
def count_palindromic_subsequences(S: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(S)
    
    # dp[i][j] will be storing the count of palindromic subsequences in the substring S[i:j+1]
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Every single character is a palindromic subsequence
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Fill the table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if S[i] == S[j]:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] + 1) % MOD
            else:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i + 1][j - 1]) % MOD
    
    # The result is the number of palindromic subsequences in the whole string
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Test cases
assert count_palindromic_subsequences("abc") == 3
assert count_palindromic_subsequences("aaa") == 6
assert count_palindromic_subsequences("abcb") == 6
assert count_palindromic_subsequences("aabaa") == 15
assert count_palindromic_subsequences("abacdfgdcaba") == 25

print("All tests passed!")
```

### Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of palindromic subsequences in the substring \( S[i:j+1] \).
2. **Base Case**: Every single character is a palindromic subsequence. So, initialize `dp[i][i] = 1` for all \( i \).
3. **Fill the Table**:
   - Use a nested loop where the outer loop controls the length of the substring and the inner loop sets the start index of the substring.
   - If the characters at the current start and end of the substring (`S[i]` and `S[j]`) are the same, update `dp[i][j]` by adding the counts from `dp[i+1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and 1 (to account for the new palindromic subsequences formed by including `S[i]` and `S[j]`).
   - If the characters are different, update `dp[i][j]` by adding the counts from `dp[i+1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`, and subtracting `dp[i+1][j-1]` to remove the double-counted subsequences.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Use modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to avoid overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.
5. **Return Result**: The result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]`, which represents the count of palindromic subsequences in the entire string \( S \).

This solution uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the number of palindromic subsequences in the string.
