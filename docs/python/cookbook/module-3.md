# Implementation Efficiency

Let's develop some reference examples that cover the essential skills and concepts you should master. This module requires efficient code implementation, manipulation of multidimensional arrays, and usage of hashmaps. Here are comprehensive examples to guide you:

### 1: Transposing a 2D Array
Transposing a matrix involves swapping its rows with columns. This is a common task that involves manipulating multidimensional arrays.

```python
def transpose(matrix):
    # Use list comprehension to create the transposed matrix
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*matrix)]

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
transposed_matrix = transpose(matrix)
print("Original Matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
print("\nTransposed Matrix:")
for row in transposed_matrix:
    print(row)
```

### 2: Efficiently Searching in a Matrix
Letâ€™s say you need to search for a specific value in a sorted matrix where each row and column is sorted in ascending order. This requires efficient traversal to ensure optimal search time.

```python
def search_sorted_matrix(matrix, target):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return False
    # Start from the top-right corner
    row, col = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1
    while row < len(matrix) and col >= 0:
        if matrix[row][col] == target:
            return True
        elif matrix[row][col] > target:
            col -= 1  # Move left
        else:
            row += 1  # Move down
    return False

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 4, 7, 11],
    [2, 5, 8, 12],
    [3, 6, 9, 16]
]
target = 5
print("Target found:", search_sorted_matrix(matrix, target))
```

### 3: Using HashMaps for Counting Frequencies
Hashmaps (dictionaries in Python) are ideal for counting occurrences of elements in an iterable due to their average O(1) time complexity for lookup and insert operations.

```python
def count_frequencies(arr):
    counts = {}
    for num in arr:
        if num in counts:
            counts[num] += 1
        else:
            counts[num] = 1
    return counts

# Example usage
arr = [2, 3, 2, 4, 3, 3, 4]
frequency = count_frequencies(arr)
print("Frequencies:")
for key, value in frequency.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

### 4: Merging Intervals
This is a common interview problem that tests your ability to manipulate data structures and implement sorting with a custom comparator.

```python
def merge_intervals(intervals):
    if not intervals:
        return []
    # First sort the intervals based on the start times
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    merged = [intervals[0]]
    for current_start, current_end in intervals[1:]:
        last_end = merged[-1][1]
        if current_start <= last_end:
            merged[-1][1] = max(last_end, current_end)  # Merge the current interval
        else:
            merged.append([current_start, current_end])
    return merged

# Example usage
intervals = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
merged_intervals = merge_intervals(intervals)
print("Merged Intervals:")
for interval in merged_intervals:
    print(interval)
```
